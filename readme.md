# Tiny Football Network

## Introduction 

Tiny Football client and server for online multiplayer version of the game.

## Getting started 

Open each client and server projects in individual Godot instances. 

Godot only has one bus, and buses cannot run parallel. For this reason, it is better to export one of the projects and run as an executable; the project being worked on can be run in the editor.

## Nakama

```
$ cd nakama
$ docker-compose up
```
